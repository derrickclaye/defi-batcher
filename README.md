## Batcher - A Defi Transaction Batcher

#### Summary

Batcher was designed with individuals new to the defi space in mind. Defi can be complex at times, so Batcher was designed to abstract away all the complexities. Batcher interacts with Uniswap's protocol and a yield farming smart contract in order to offer its users pathways to transact on. Each pathway only requires a single input.

#### Pathways
1. **swap:**  swap eth for uni

2. **swap -> add liquidity:**  swap eth for uni then provide liquidity to UNI/WETH liquidity pool

3. **swap -> add liquidity -> yield farm:**  swap eth for uni, provide liquidity to UNI/WETH liquidity pool, then take LP token and put it a yield farming smart contract in return for PumpToken
